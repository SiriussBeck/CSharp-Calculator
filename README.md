# C# Calculator

A simple calculator, I was just bored, that's it.

## Build

Clone this repository, go to the CSharp-Calculator folder and use the dotnet tool to compile.

```bash
gh repo clone pySiriusDev/CSharp-Calculator
```

```bash
cd CSharp-Calculator
```

```bash
dotnet build Calculator.csproj
```
